# oxocarbon-black-iterm2
</div>
A darker, blacker oxocarbon. Forked from "nyoom-engineering/oxocarbon-iterm2" iTerm2 theme, inspired by IBM Carbon.

I didn't like how light nyoom-engineering/oxocarbon-iterm2 was so I made it black. 
Feel free to use it.

## Install

1. Download the `.itermcolors` file with the following command:

```bash
cd $HOME/Downloads
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/limitedink/oxocarbon-black-iterm2/main/oxocarbon-black.itermcolors
```

2. Go to `Settings -> Profiles -> Colors` and click `Color Presets` and then `import`. From the file picker, select the `.itermcolors` file in your downloads folder
3. Reclick `Color Presets` and than select `oxocarbon-black`
